SPEEDTEST:
--------------------------
1. Navigate to ~/auvsi_communications/speedtest on the RPi
2. Run "sh ./server.sh"
	Keep the ssh open to make sure nothing crashes
3. git clone https://github.com/charlie-coleman/auvsi_communications.git
   if you haven't done so already somewhere on the PC acting as server
4. Navigate to auvsi_communications/speedtest on the PC
5. Run "sh ./client.sh N" where N is the number of speed test trials you want to do.
6. Record output

CAMERA:
--------------------------
1. Navigate to ~/auvsi_communications/camera on the groundstation
2. Ensure the RPi and camera are plugged in and turned on.
3. SSH into the RPi, navigate to ~/auvsi_communications/camera
4. Navigate to the same folder on the groundstation
5. Run "python3 groundstation.py" on the groundstation
6. Run "python3 rpi.py" on the RPi
7. Hit enter to stop the RPi, Ctrl+C to stop groundstation

If you run "sh camera.sh" on the groundstation, it should ssh and start the
proper scripts, but there isn't any way to stop it from taking pics, so stay on
the safe side and start things manually


The SSH password is "auvsirpi"
